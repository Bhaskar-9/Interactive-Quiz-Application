##The task involves creating a dynamic Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches multiple-choice questions from the Open Trivia DB API and displays them interactively on a web page. Upon loading, the application retrieves 10 questions asynchronously, decodes any HTML entities in the text, and presents the questions with shuffled answer options using JavaScript DOM manipulation. Users select an answer and submit it, upon which the app checks for correctness, updates the score, and automatically moves to the next question. Once all questions are answered, the application displays the userâ€™s final score along with the correct answers for each question. The UI is styled using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure a clean layout, and interactive elements like hover effects enhance the user experience. The project emphasizes key web development concepts such as API integration, asynchronous programming, dynamic UI rendering, and event handling, making it a solid learning exercise for building interactive, data-driven web applications.
